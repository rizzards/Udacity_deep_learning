# Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree

The content of the repo is divided into 4 modules proposed by the nanodegree focusing on:
1) deep learning introduction
2) convolutional neural networks
3) recurrent neural networks and transformers
4) generative adversarial networks

Each module contains a project, which respectively are:
1) CNN_Handwritten_Digits_Classifier
2) CNN_Landmark_Classification_Tagging
3) RNN_Text_Translation_and_Sentiment_Analysis
4) DCGAN_Face_Generarion
